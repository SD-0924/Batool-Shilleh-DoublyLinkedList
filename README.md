# Doubly Linked List

This project is an implementation of a Doubly Linked List using JavaScript. It includes a set of basic methods for manipulating the list, such as adding, removing, and modifying elements.

## Structure

- **Node.js**: Definition of the node in the list.
- **DoublyLinkedList.js**: Implementation of the doubly linked list and associated operations.
- **main.js**: Testing the functionalities and operations on the list.

## Features

- Add a value to the end of the list using `push(val)`.
- Remove the last value from the list using `pop()`.
- Remove the first value from the list using `shift()`.
- Add a value to the beginning of the list using `unshift(val)`.
- Get a value at a specific index using `get(index)`.
- Set a value at a specific index using `set(index, val)`.
- Insert a value at a specific index using `insert(index, val)`.
- Remove a value from a specific index using `remove(index)`.
- Display the values in the list using `display()`.
